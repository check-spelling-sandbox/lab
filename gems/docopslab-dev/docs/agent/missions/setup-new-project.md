# MISSION: Start a New DocOps Lab Project

This document is intended for AI agents operating within a DocOps Lab environment.

An AI Agent or multiple Agents, in collaboration with a human Operator, can initialize and prepare a codebase for a new DocOps Lab project.

This codebase can be based on an existing specification document, or one can be drafted during this procedure.

## Agent Roles

The following agent roles will take a turn at steps in this mission.

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">planner/architect (optional)</dt>
<dd>
If there is no specification yet, this agent works with the Operator and any relevant documentation to draft a project specification and/or definition documents.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">product engineer</dt>
<dd>
Initialize the basic environment and dependencies; oversee DevOps, DocOps, and QA contributions; wireframe/scaffold basic library structure.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">QA/testing engineer</dt>
<dd>
Set up testing frameworks and initial/demonstrative test cases.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">DevOps/release engineer</dt>
<dd>
Set up CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and infrastructure as code.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">project manager</dt>
<dd>
Review the initial project setup; create initial work issues and tasks for further development.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">tech writer</dt>
<dd>
Assist in writing/reviewing specification docs and README.
</dd>
</dl>

### Context Management for Multi-role Sessions

By default will be up to the Agent to decide whether to hand off to a concurrent or subsequent Agent or “upgrade” role/skills during a session.

The Operator may of course dictate or override this decision.

The goal is to use appropriate agents without cluttering any given agent’s context window.

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Soft-reset between roles</dt>
<dd>
At each transition, declare what you’re loading (role doc + skills) and what you’re backgrounding. Don’t hold all previous stage details in active memory.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Mission tracker as swap file</dt>
<dd>
Dump detailed handoff notes into `.agent/project-setup-mission.md` after each stage. Read it first when starting new roles to understand what was built and what’s needed.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Checkpoint between stages</dt>
<dd>
After each stage, ask Operator to review/continue/pause. Creates intervention points if focus dilutes.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Watch for dilution</dt>
<dd>
Mixing concerns across roles, contradicting earlier decisions, hedging instead of checking files. If noticed, stop and checkpoint.
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Focused lenses</dt>
<dd>
Each role emphasizes different details (Product Engineer = code structure, QA = test coverage, DevOps = automation, PM = coordination). Switch lenses deliberately; shared base knowledge (README, goals, conventions) stays warm.
</dd>
</dl>

### Task Assignments and Suggestions

In the Mission Procedures section, metadata is associated with each task.

All tasks are assigned a preferred `role:` the Agent should assume in carrying out the task. That role has further documentation at `.agent/docs/roles/<role-slug>.md`, and the executing agent should ingest that document entirely before proceeding.

Recommended collaborators are indicated by `with:`.

Recommended upgrades are designated by `upto:`.

Suggested skill/topic readings are indicated by `read:`.

Any working directories or files are listed in `path:`.

## Prerequisite: Attention OPERATOR

This process requires the `docopslab-dev` tooling is installed and synced, or at the very least the `.agent/docs/` library maintained by that tool be in place.

For unorthodox projects, simply copying an up-to-date version of that library to your project root directory should suffice.

## Mission Procedure

In general, the following stages are to be followed in order and tracked in a mission document.

### Stage 0: Mission Prep

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Create a mission-tracking document</dt>
<dd>
Write a document with detailed steps for fulfilling the mission assigned here, based on any project-specific context that might rule in or out some of the following stages or steps. (`role: project-manager; path: .agent/project-setup-mission.md`)
</dd>
</dl>

### Evergreen Tasks

The following tasks apply to most stages.

Use `gh` tool or instruct the Operator to use the GH Web UI to prepare the Issues facility. Make sure to set up appropriate labels and milestones, and ensure API read/write access. (`role: project-manager; read: [.agent/docs/skills/github-issues.md];`)
</dd>
</dl>

### Stage 10: Create Initial Work Issues

<dt class="hdlist1">Draft an IMYML file</dt>
<dd>
Add all the issues to a scratch file in IMYML format. (`role: project-manager; read: .agent/docs/skills/github-issues.md; path: .agent/scratch/initial-issues.yml; with: Operator`)
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Bulk create initial issues</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
</dl>

### Post-mission Debriefing

<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Review Mission Report</dt>
<dd>
Highlight outstanding or special notices from the Mission Report. (`role: Agent; with: Operator; read: .agent/reports/project-setup-mission.md`)
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Suggest modifications to _this_ mission assignment</dt>
<dd>
Taking into account any bumps, blockers, or unexpected occurrences during fulfillment of this mission, recommend changes or additions to **“MISSION: Start a New DocOps Lab Project”** itself. Put yourself in the shoes of a future agent facing down an unknown project. (`role: Agent; with: Operator; path: ../lab/_docs/agent/missions/setup-new-project.adoc`).
</dd>
</dl>

## Fulfillment Principles

### ALWAYS

- Always ask the Operator when you don’t know exactly how DocOps Lab prefers a step be carried out.

- Always follow the mission procedure as closely as possible, adapting only when necessary due to project-specific constraints.

- Always document any deviations from the standard procedure and the reasons for them in the Mission Report.

- Always look for a DRY way to define product metadata/attrbutes in README.adoc and YAML files (`specs/data/*-def.yml`).

- Always pause for Operator approval before ANY publishing or deployment action, including pushing/posting to GitHub.

### NEVER

- Never get creative or innovative without Operator permission.

- Never skip steps in the mission procedure without documenting the reason.

- Never assume the Operator understands DocOps Lab conventions without explanation.

### Quality Bar

A good output is a codebase that a human engineer could pick up and continue developing with minimal onboarding due to logical structure and conventions as well as clear documentation of the architecture, setup process, and project-specific considerations.
